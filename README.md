# asdf-calicoctl
[Calicoctl](https://github.com/roboll/calicoctl) plugin for the [asdf](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf) version manager.
calicoctl was moved from it's own repository into the calico repository which broke [the original plugin](https://github.com/teejaded/asdf-calicoctl). This version fixes this, but only works on v3.20.0 and above.

## Install

```
asdf plugin-add calicoctl https://github.com/kfoxb/asdf-calicoctl.git
```

## Use

Check out the [asdf](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf) readme for instructions.
